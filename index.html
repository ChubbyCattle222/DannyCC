        "Chubby Cattle is so unique because of their bold willingness to innovate. The arcade machines made me feel nostalgic with there collection of classic video games. Our server Danny C went over the menu and the layout of the restaurant. He explained that this is their flagship location and offers features like the arcade, sterilized eggs, and self serve drinks near Chubby Tea. Danny C asked if we had alergies or were celebrating anything. He cooked all the meats perfectly and paired them with the best sauces. The 90 minute dining limit felt just right, and the ice cream flavors like Taro and Matcha were a perfect way to end the meal. Danny C truely provided top tier service. Be sure to ask for Danny C if you visit for an unforgettable experience!",
